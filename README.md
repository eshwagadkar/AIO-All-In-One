All-In-One is a fictional booking website. The project consists of implementing an UI page after a user has logged in to his/her account.
The project is built using HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, and some cool animation effects.
The UI page adapts very well for all device screens making it very responsive and is developed using mobile-first strategy.
The UI page adapts very well for large device screens such as tablets and desktops.
